Rackspace Cloud Files CLI Uploader
==================================

This is a Python command-line utility for uploading from the local dedicated server filesystem to Rackspace Cloud Files. Its purpose was to allow legacy PHP4 applications, which were not officially supported by Rackspace, to make programmatic calls to the cloud API.

(Please note that this was developed before Rackspace moved to Openstack.)
